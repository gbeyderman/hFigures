Health Figures
==============
Inspired by the hGraph, hFigures aims to deliver a starting point for interactive health data visualization.

The file simple.html is an example using a small dataset comprising basic health measurements.

For a holistic visualization of a complex dataset, the file complex.html provides an overview of the library visualization capabilities.

This library has been submited as a Software article to the journal BioMed Central.
