Health Figures
==============
Inspired by the hGraph, hFigures is a javascript library that aims to deliver a starting point for interactive health data visualization.

The file `simple.html` is an example using a small dataset comprising basic health measurements.

For a holistic visualization of a complex dataset, the file `complex.html` provides an overview of the library visualization capabilities.

This library has been submited as a Software article to the BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making journal.

### Requirements
hFigures was built with [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), a copy of the library is included in this repository. All rights and license terms apply to the d3.js library accordingly.

### How to navigate


Click and drag anywhere in the screen to pan along the figure.


Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the figure.


When zooming in, the labels for each measurement will become visible.

### Visualization
